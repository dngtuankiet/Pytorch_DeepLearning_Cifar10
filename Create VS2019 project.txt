GUIDE TO IMPORT LIBTORCH C++ AND LOAD A TORCH SCRIPT MODEL VISUAL STUDIO 2019

IMPORT LIBTORCH C++ LIBRARY TO VISUAL STUDIO 2019

-Open Project Configuration
-Choose Configuration Release - Platform x64
-Open C/C++/General:
	In Additional Include Directories, add:
		C:\libtorch\include\torch\csrc\api\include\torch
		C:\libtorch\include
		C:\Python38\include
-Open Linker/General:
	In Additional Library Directories, add:
		C:\Python38\libs
		C:\libtorch\lib
-Open Linker/Input:
	In Addition Dependencies, add:
		torch.lib
 		torch_cpu.lib
 		c10.lib
 		python38.lib //depend on the version of Python in C:\Python38\libs
-Open Build Events/Post-build Event:
	In Command Line, add:
		copy /y C:\libtorch\lib\*.dll



IMPORT A MODEL USING LIBTORCH C++ LIBRARY

-Create a "CmakeLists.txt" with the following content
	cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0 FATAL_ERROR)

	project(PytorchTest)		//Can be change with different name of the project

	find_package(Torch REQUIRED)

	option(CMAKE_USE_WIN32_THREADS_INIT "using WIN32 threads" ON)
	option(gtest_disable_pthreads "Disable uses of pthreads in gtest." ON)

	add_executable(PytorchTest PytorchTest/PytorchTest.cpp)		//Can be change with different name of the project

	target_link_libraries(PytorchTest "${TORCH_LIBRARIES}")		//Can be change with different name of the project

	set_property(TARGET PytorchTest PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 14)	//Can be change with different name of the project
	
-Save the Cmake file in Project folder

-Sample C++ code of loading an exported model can be found in: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html

-You can build the project at this stage to check the above configuration is ok or not (You can skip this and go to the next step).
 But after building the application cant run yet.

-On VS2019 Tab, Open Tools/Command Line/Developer Command Prompt:
	Run the following command:
		cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:/libtorch		// "C:/libtorch" is the path of libtorch library in my PC
	If error occurs, keep run the command for a few times, until it reports success.

-After that, VS2019 will pop up a window to Reload the enviroment, click "Reload"

-In the Solution Explorer:
	You may see that ALL_BUILD is chosen as the startup project
	Right Click on your project, choose "Set As StarTup Project"

-Open Project Configuration

-Open Build Events/Post-build Event:
	In Command Line, add:
		copy /y C:\libtorch\lib\*.dll
